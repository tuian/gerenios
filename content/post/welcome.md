**Welcome to my Office 365 blog!** 

In this blog I'll discuss about various aspects of administering Office 365 suite.

Administering Office 365 is somewhat easy if you know the basics. However, there are many tricks that can ease your job, but also issues nobody has ever told you about!

I'll update by blog regularly, so there is plenty of new blogs and articles to come. In the meantime, you can check my first [PowerShell](/powershell/) article.

If there is something special you'd like to know about, please send me an email to [nestori.syynimaa@gerenios.com](mailto:nestori.syynimaa@gerenios.com?subject=Blog suggestion: ).
